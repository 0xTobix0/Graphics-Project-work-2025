# Skybox Textures

This directory should contain 6 images for the skybox, one for each face of the cube. The images should be named as follows:

- `right.jpg`  - Positive X-axis (Right)
- `left.jpg`   - Negative X-axis (Left)
- `top.jpg`    - Positive Y-axis (Top)
- `bottom.jpg` - Negative Y-axis (Bottom)
- `front.jpg`  - Positive Z-axis (Front)
- `back.jpg`   - Negative Z-axis (Back)

## How to Add Park Scenery

1. Prepare 6 images of your park scenery, one for each face of the skybox.
2. Make sure the images are seamless where they meet at the edges.
3. Save them in JPG format with the exact names listed above.
4. Place all 6 images in this directory.
5. The skybox will automatically load these textures when the program starts.

## Image Requirements

- Format: JPG
- Recommended size: 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 pixels
- All images should have the same dimensions
- Images should be seamless (tileable) on the edges where they meet

## Testing

After adding the images, run the program. The skybox should now display your park scenery as the background.
